# About Hospital Prices

As per law, every hospital in US must publish prices for at least 300 shoppable services on their websites,
for public to access and shop for services before they receive care.

We are planning to review each Hospital and share our findings at [https://www.hospitalprices.app](https://www.hospitalprices.app).

To help everybody in the eco-system to further the cause, we are planning to make available every aspect of this work
(data, findings, code etc) on a public Github repository, [https://github.com/hospitalprices](https://github.com/hospitalprices).

This contributors guide is also made publicly available at [https://www.hospitalprices.dev](https://www.hospitalprices.dev).
